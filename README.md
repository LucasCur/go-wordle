## ðŸ’» Wordle
- A working command-line-interface Wordle clone created in golang.
- An alternate version created in python is available on my github.
- As ANSI escape codes are used for formatting, i.e. clearing the terminal & colors, it's recommended to use a terminal that supports them for the program to be usable, such as
- - Windows Terminal
- - Git Bash
- - PowerShell
- - Linux Terminals (such as xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, and many more)
- - macOS Terminal
- - Cygwin
- - Putty
- 
## User Interface

- Key to show what each symbol means
- Counter to show how many tries left and on what try you won or lost
- Section displaying the word tried and what characters are correct / in correct place etc.
