## ðŸ’» Wordle
- A CLI Wordle clone created in golang. I made this as my first golang project after roughly a day of experimentation so there's going to be lots of space for improvement.

- As ANSI escape codes are used for formatting, i.e. clearing the terminal & colors, it's recommended to use a terminal that supports them for the program to be usable, such as
1. Windows Terminal
2. Git Bash
3. PowerShell
4. Linux Terminals (such as xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, and many more)
5. macOS Terminal
6. Cygwin
7. Putty

## User Interface

- Key to show what each symbol means
- Counter to show how many tries left and on what try you won or lost
- Section displaying the word tried and what characters are correct / in correct place etc.
