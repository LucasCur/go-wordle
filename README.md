## ðŸ’» Wordle
- A CLI Wordle clone created in golang. I made this as my first golang project after roughly a day of experimentation and learning the basics so there's going to be lots of space for improvement.

- As ANSI escape codes are used for formatting, i.e. clearing the terminal & colors, it's recommended to use a terminal that supports them for the program to be usable, such as: 
  1. Windows Terminal
  2. Git Bash
  3. PowerShell
  4. Linux Terminals (such as xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, and many more)
  5. macOS Terminal
  6. Cygwin
  7. Putty

## User Interface

- White - Letter does not exist in target word
- Yellow - Letter does exist, however is in the wrong place
- Green - Letter does exist, and is in the correct place
- Popup that says the game win / lose state as well as asking for confirmation of game continuance
